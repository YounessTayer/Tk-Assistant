# Tk-Assistant V4.1 April 2021

The idea of Tk Assistant is to help beginners that are learning to create GUI's with Python and Tkinter for the first time.

Tk Assistant can help users to get aquainted quickly with the widgets and flatten the very steep Tk learning curve.
 
The 55 code examples (squirts) supplied are all self-contained, so can be experimented with at will.

You will soon find it fairly simple to start joining the code examples together to make your own GUI's and then edit and improve or change the code to your
requirements.

Windows Only.
